[CUDA tutorial][1]  
[CUDA online tutorial from NVIDIA][2]  
[PCL/OpenNI tutorial][3]
[Building OpenNI2 for the Structure Sensor][4]
  
## 1. Where is libSensorSys.so? (need to check with Gu Qiyuan)
> - Bin/NewSensor
> - Bin/Debug(Release)/NewSensor   
   
## 2. link libraries *libDMTrans.so* & *libLayerFilter.so* are programmed by Liu Yehang and both are GPU related.   

## 3. what is .cu file?
> .cu file is a developer file written for CUDA (Compute Unified Devices Architecture) and NVIDIA architecture created for parallel processing on NVIDIA GPUs, .cu files are called "kernels", which are processing units that can run in parallel on NVIDIA's CUDA-based GPUs. Kernels are compiles with **nvcc**, a compiler program included with the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit.  
  
## 4. CUDA tutorial
The extention to the C programming language are four-fold: 

> **Function** type qualifiers to specify whether a function executes on the host or on the device and whether it is callable from the host or from the device **\_\_global\_\_, \_\_device\_\_, \_\_host\_\_**. 

> **Variable** type qulifiers to specify the *memory location* of a variable **\_\_device\_\_, \_\_shared\_\_**. 

> Four build-in variables that specify the **grid and block dimensions** and the **block and thread indices**: **gridDim, blockIdx, blockDim, threadIdx**  
  
## 5. Steps in CUDA code
**Host code (xx.cpp & xx.cu):**

> (1). Initialize/acquire device (GPU)  
> (2). Allocate memory on GPU  
> (3). Copy data from host to GPU  
> (4). Execute kernel on GPU  
> (5). Copy data from GPU to host  
> (6). Deallocate memory on GPU  
> (7). Release device  
> (8). Run "Gold" version on host  
> (9). Compare results  


## 6. Kernel code (xx_kernel.cu): 
A kernel is a function callable from the host and executed on the CUDA device -- simultaneously by many threads in parllel. How to call a kernel involves **specify the name of the kernel** and **an execution configuration**. An execution configuration is just defining **the number of parallel threads in a group** and **the number of groups to use** when running the kernel for the CUDA device.



## 7. NVIDIA CUDA programming basics: 
> - Programming model
> - Memory model
> - CUDA API basics



## 8. CUDA Programming model
The resulting program is called a **Kernel**, the batch of threads that executes a kernel is organized as a grid of thread blocks.



## 9. Ubuntu14.04 install obec camera driver and OpenNI2
(1). dependencies:  
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential freeglut3
sudo apt-get install -y g++ python libusb-1.0-0-dev freeglut3-dev doxygen graphviz
sudo apt-get install libudev-dev
```

(2). check udev version, Orbbec Driver need libudev.so.1, if can't find it, can make symbolic link from libudev.so.x.x, **which usually locate in /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu or /lib/i386-linux-gnu**
```
$ldconfig -p | grep libudev.so.1
$cd /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
$sudo ln -s libudev.so.x.x.x libudev.so.1
```

(3). copy tgz file to any place you want(e.g., Home) and unzip tgz file
```
$ tar zxvf OpenNI-Linux-x64-2.2-0118.tgz
$ cd OpenNI-Linux-x64-2.2
```

(4). run install.sh to generate OpenNIDevEnvironment, which contains OpenNI development environment 
```
$ sudo chmod a+x install.sh
$ sudo ./install.sh
```

(5). **please replug in the device for usb-register**

(6). add environment variables
```
$ source OpenNIDevEnvironment
```
copy the texts in "OpenNIDevEnvironment" file to **.bashrc** and source it 

(7). copy .so to system user library
```
sudo cp OpenNI-Linux-x64-2.3/Redist/OpenNI2/Drivers/* /usr/lib/OpenNI2/Drivers/
```

(8). get source code:
```
git clone http://github.com/occipital/OpenNI2.git
cd OpenNI2
make 
sudo cp -r Include /usr/include/openni2
sudo cp -r Bin/x64-Release/OpenNI2 /usr/lib/
sudo cp Bin/x64-Release/libOpenNI2.* /usr/lib/
```

(9). create packageconfig file for obec camera 
```
sudo gedit /usr/lib/pkgconfig/libopenni2.pc
```
in this file, write: 
```
prefix=/usr   
exec_prefix=${prefix}
libdir=${exec_prefix}/lib
includedir=${prefix}/include/openni2

Name: OpenNI2
Description: A general purpose driver for all OpenNI cameras.
Version: 2.2.0.0
Cflags: -I${includedir}
Libs: -L${libdir} -lOpenNI2 -L${libdir}/OpenNI2/Drivers -lDummyDevice -lOniFile -lorbbec -lPS1080 -lPSLink
```
check packageconfig
```
pkg-config --modversion libopenni2
```

(10). check **/usr/lib/OpenNI2/Driver/** folder
>- libDummyDevice
>- libOniFile
>- liborbbec
>- libPS1080
>- libPSLink

(11). have fun with your project :)
