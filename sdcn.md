2. There're 2 distinct approaches to autonomous development:

>- A **robotics** approach: fuses output from a suite of sensors to directly measure the vehicle surroundings and then navigate accordingly  
>- A **deep learning** approach: teach computer learn how to drive by mimicking human driving behavior        

3. Projects to build in this fantastic program

# Week 2: Finding Lane Lines on the Road

**[ x ] 1. what is the problem? -> [ x ] 2. color selection -> [  ] 3. region masking -> [  ] 4. canny edge detection -> [  ] 5. hough transform -> [  ] 6. project 1**

## 1. What is the problem?

how to perceive the world.

camera is just like our eyes

identify and track the position of the lane lines in a series of images(video)

## 2. Color Selection

a color image is combined of 3 channels : R(ed), G(reen), B(lue).

each of these color channels contains pixels whose values range from 0(black) to 255(white).

**Always make a COPY of array or images, otherwise it is just a reference**

## 3. Region Masking

region interest us

in this case, we could assume that the camera that took the image is mounted in a fixed position on the front of the car, therefore, the lane lines will always appear in the same general region of the image

## 4. Canny edge detection

## 5. Hough transform

## 6. Project 1
