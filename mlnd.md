**Tools: ** python

## Syllabus (10 Parts, 6 Projects)

## Part 1: Introduction

**prerequisites**: basic statistics / calculus / linear algebra

### 0. What is Machine Learning?

>  *Teaching computers to learn to perform tasks from past experiences.*

- **Artificial Intelligent**: process some data and understand data, react intelligently to it. 
- **Statistics**: apply advanced formulas to really make sense and compare and evaluate and summarize data.
- **Algorithms**: operates on some data input, it provides some output.

### 1. Machine Learning is everywhere

Machine Learning can be applied to nearly every domain, for example:

- Trading: predict what stocks will perform well over the next months or year.
- Education: identify what students might be at risk for not graduating, or not completing a class early in their studies, so teachers can intervene and help them along earlier.
- Health care: try to identify patients who have certain illness, or are at risk for certain diseases

### 2. Tips

- **Stick to your schedule**, working regularly on the courses and projects
- **Be relentless in searching for an answer on your own**, the struggle and search is where you learn the most
- **Share with others**, be an active member of the community
- **Have fun!**
