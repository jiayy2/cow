# Robotics: Vision Intelligence and Machine Learning
Vision intelligence: allows a robot to "sense" and "recognize" the surrounding envrionment and also enables a robot to "learn" from the memory of past experiences by extracting patterns in visual signals.
Machine learning: how Machine Learning extracts statistically meaningful patterns in data that support classification, regression and clustering. Then by studying Computer Vision and Machine Learning together you will be able to build recognition algorithms that can learn from data and adapt to new environments.
